## Go (golang) support for the Apple Push Notification service

{{ .EmitSynopsis }}

### Install

Install with:

  go get github.com/JeremyOT/goapenuts

### Example

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
  "crypto/tls"
  "encoding/hex"
  apns "github.com/JeremyOT/goapenuts"
)

func main() {
  // Note key & cert must match the sandbox option
  apnsCert, _ := tls.LoadX509KeyPair("PATH_TO_CERT_FILE", "PATH_TO_KEY_FILE")
  sandbox := true
  // Keep the last 100 payloads in memory incase a resend is needed
  bufferSize := 100
  apnsConnection = apns.NewConnection(apnsCert, sandbox, bufferSize)
  apnsConnection.Connect()
  token, _ := hex.DecodeString("TOKEN_HEX_STRING")
  // See Apple docs for JSON structure
  // https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/Chapters/ApplePushService.html
  payload := []byte("PAYLOAD_JSON_DATA")
  // Send the notification with an expiration one hour from now (Apple will retry this notification for up to an hour if it fails)
  apnsConnection.Send(apns.NewPersistentPayload(token, payload, time.Hour))
  wait := time.After(time.Second)
  select {
  // Check for an error and print it, no other action is necessary. goapenuts.Connection will automatically attempt to resend as needed.
  case err := <- apnsCapnsConnection:
    fmt.Println("APNS error:", err)
  }
  case <- wait:
    //Wait 1 second for the notification to send (happens much faster than this)
  }
}
```

### Notes

Connection.Send() is threadsafe and will block until the connection can send the notification. You may use multiple Connections for increased throughput.
